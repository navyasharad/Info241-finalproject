1,First,11:33:55,11:35:20,0:01:25,4,8,5,the second one feels so real with the objects,I love it,
1,Second,11:37:55,11:38:46,0:00:51,9,8,1,It was so cool,"I loved it
",

2,Second,11:41:53,11:43:34,0:01:41,3,3,7,n/a,going around the maze made me nauseous,
3,First,11:41:53,11:51:25,0:09:32,8,9,6,it was fun ,got trippier once i entered the dome area,
3,Second,11:55:30,11:56:57,0:01:27,7,8,8,it was  more clear that i had to enter the central space,this made me more nauseous,
4,First,11:52:43,11:54:08,0:01:25,6,8,6,"I liked it, wish there was more to do ",I didnt like that I didn't have an avatar,
4,Second,11:58:08,11:59:35,0:01:27,7,8,5,"I like the fact that it felt almost like i could jump off a cliff, it felt enthralling","Again, not much to do",
5,First,12:02:10,12:04:07,0:01:57,4,6,7,that it's over now,i hate being in VR environments because they make my head hurt after more than a few minutes. it was nice that i was allowed to exit the environment/experience whenever i wanted to! felt like things were more on my own terms that way. ,
5,Second,12:08:16,12:09:44,0:01:28,3,6,6,n/a,same stuff as before; i just don't like being in a VR environment because i get headaches pretty quickly ,

6,Second,12:25:56,12:26:58,0:01:02,6,7,8,n/a,n/a,
7,First,12:25:00,12:26:39,0:01:39,6,8,6,I like the environment!!,I feel bit dizzy,
7,Second,12:42:20,12:44:14,0:01:54,7,4,3,I like that its much calm compared to the first environment,The glass color was too light to figure the way inside,
8,First,12:45:30,12:47:48,0:02:18,5,7,7,the nature part of it.,nauseating . ,
8,Second,12:51:00,12:51:56,0:00:56,5,7,8,same like first one,it was nauseating!,
9,First,12:48:50,12:51:00,0:02:10,5,8,6,It made me experience myself sort of on a different scale,"it made me feel like I was constrained, I was not able to just move or experience freely",
9,Second,12:59:00,1:01:05,12:02:05,3,8,7,n/a,"it seemed like i could walk through the walls, but then I could not.",
10,First,12:54:20,12:58:10,0:03:50,4,5,8,the heart of the dome and that i could see the sky and the trees inside it,feeling nausea and not being able to jump off that area,
10,Second,1:09:10,1:11:17,0:02:07,3,5,7,trying out vr,nausea,
11,First,1:00:31,1:02:09,0:01:38,6,5,7,"it was fun to ""walk around"" a bit. It made me want to actually visit a place like this in real life.",Very little way to actually interact with the environment apart from walk around. Wanted to climb the dome or have other kind of interactions with the nature and building. ,
11,Second,1:16:31,1:18:30,0:01:59,5,4,7,"Very interesting structure, visually new","It felt less descriptive than the last one? The last one I could tell the structure was made of brick but this one it was even less clear what it was, it could have been glass or resin or plastic or maybe it was fabric? hard to tell",
12,First,10:30:37,10:36:17,0:05:40,8,4,7,I liked the layers and having a little maze to explore! I also enjoyed the details- the flowers and the leaves! ,I get motion sickness so I felt a bit dizzy! I also ended up getting stuck ,
12,Second,10:40:45,10:45:32,0:04:47,7,4,8,Figuring out how to jump was fun! I also liked looking at the planets in the sky! ,I didn’t figure out how to get on top of the structure - I also felt much much more motion sickness probably because of the jumping ,
13,First,10:41:35,10:44:48,0:03:13,7,5,5,The light coming through the top of the structure and the green trees. Also really enjoyed the freedom to explore and see whatever I wanted to see. I felt like I was learning something new and exploring.,"When I started jumping is when I started to feel some nausea, otherwise I was fine.",
13,Second,10:48:53,10:51:07,0:02:14,5,5,7,Still lots of greenery that was nice. Since it was similar to the first one I felt like there was less to explore.,I felt more nausea which I was surprised by? I felt like the blue lines were changing more and being combined with the clear walls made me feel like I was moving more.,
14,First,11:31:31,11:35:48,0:04:17,7,3,5,i liked the brick structure and the way it created pockets of light and shadow. the biophilia in the space also added to a positive experience of the space. ,it wasn’t horribly nauseating until i got close to the structure but moving around in it was extremely subpar. if there’s a way to slow down the movements it would make it very relaxing to move through the space but right now it was kind of stressful.,
14,Second,11:41:55,11:45:07,0:03:12,7,2,4,the transparency of the structure was very beautiful look at! i was also less nauseous moving around this space. ,it felt less protected/ enveloping than the brick structure. ,
15,First,12:01:14,12:02:30,0:01:16,6,4,1,"I liked that the brick pavilion had small openings so I couldn’t see what’s inside, leading me to be curious and go in, I liked the geometric shape of the top opening of the pavilion ","I guess it was small and I’d want to see more,",
15,Second,12:06:00,12:07:15,0:01:15,5,4,1,I thought the transparent material for the walls and a more ethereal feeling. The transparency framed the plants in an artistic way,"I could see what I would expect from the outside, I went inside to check it out but felt less inclined since I could see it from the outside",
16,First,12:20:44,12:23:48,0:03:04,7,5,2,Mostly seamless and intuitive. Seems like a Useful model of 3d space.,Movement can be too fast. Maybe we could be sitting instead of standing.,
16,Second,12:20:35,12:30:52,0:10:17,4,5,3,Still a useful model to understand the space.  The transparent structure was interesting.,Felt a bit disoriented and dizzy and couldn't do it for too long.,
17,First,2:10:55,2:13:15,0:02:20,6,3,1,"warm, green, comfortable",space was deserted which doesn't sit right,
17,Second,2:17:21,2:18:12,0:00:51,8,2,3,"brick walls feel solid and homely, the maze is fun to explore and the space at the centre feels safe while still fresh and open",n/a,
18,First,2:14:27,2:15:21,0:00:54,8,6,6,It felt so calm and peaceful getting to explore.,"I felt like my body was actually moving forward, even though it wasn’t, which made me feel pretty disoriented.",
18,Second,2:20:24,2:21:47,0:01:23,4,7,7,It was fun navigating the maze!,Too many stimuli making me feel uneasy!,
19,First,2:33:28,2:34:27,0:00:59,5,6,6,The novelty of the experience ,I wanted to fall forward while virtually moving forward through the space,
19,Second,2:40:55,2:41:40,0:00:45,7,5,5,The novelty of the experience and how we can experience different environment designs through VR,"I still felt like I wanted to step forward when virtually walking (my hamstrings even flexed at times), BUT the brick walls helped to mitigate these sensations. When I explored the space outside the structure the falling forward experience was more pronounced than within the structure. ",
20,First,2:44:07,2:46:21,0:02:14,4,3,7,It's great that there is no instruction and just let me explore on  my own.,"I didn't really know what's goal of the experience, and the moving caused some nausea.",
20,Second,2:52:50,2:54:19,0:01:29,6,5,5,I really like the vibe of the whole space: how the trees growing with the brick walls.,"I think I'm walking too fast, I kinda wanna slow it down.",
21,First,3:18:10,3:19:35,0:01:25,7,3,7,"I liked the nature elements (trees, bushes, landscape), and the circular structure in the middle was interesting. I liked that it had a little maze-like aspect, that it was semi-transparent, and it felt calm inside","It was lacking a little bit in terms of interest / things to explore, and feeling nauseous also wasn’t enjoyable - I moved around the space more slowly to account for the nausea",
21,Second,3:26:36,3:28:07,0:01:31,5,4,7,I liked the tall ceiling of the structure and the way there was a gap in the roof for light to come in,"I didn’t like the sharp angles of the structure or the brick walls, I also was more apprehensive at first  than in the first environment because I could tell what would be beyond the inner space that I was it (I thought it would be a bigger maze than it ended up being). The structure also didn’t look so nice in the landscape compared to the first one, it felt more imposing & less harmonious ",
22,First,3:43:30,3:45:44,0:02:14,5,3,8,"It’s peaceful viewpoints, as it’s hard to visit those places in the real world. Take a few minutes to rest during busy daily life","The scene is calm and peaceful, but I tend to have very high nausea even when I’m taking an elevator. So I was very dizzy during the experiment. ",
22,Second,3:52:15,3:54:04,0:01:49,7,6,4,"The transparent material. Compared to the first one, it looks more unrealistic and gives me a wider field of view, so I didn’t really feel dizzy","Actually same comment for both options. Remote controller sometimes flipped, which made me hard to move very freely. But I think this is just a technical issue. The overall virtual environment itself was definitely pleasant compared to the first one. ",
23,First,3:46:45,3:48:40,0:01:55,3,2,1,Seeing water,Not being able to go in the water and also the clear edge of the envt,
23,Second,3:55:35,3:56:26,0:00:51,4,3,1,Moves quicker; trees,Same ... Can't go to the water; plus clunky border / wish it was continuous ,
24,First,4:22:50,4:25:43,0:02:53,6,6,1,More futuristic or like Roblox enviroment  ,Hard to move around walls sometimes or get atuck,
24,Second,4:28:10,4:29:13,0:01:03,6,6,1,Obstacles ,Too bland not much to do at all,
25,First,5:51:43,5:52:36,0:00:53,9,4,2,n/a,n/a,
25,Second,5:54:43,5:56:20,0:01:37,8,4,2,n/a,When looking left or right it was not as smooth as previous VR experience and grass sometimes would glitch at my feet.,
26,First,5:06:35,5:07:34,0:00:59,9,9,2,I enjoyed seeing the water and the landscape from the distance. It was my first time using a VR device which was nice ,Just the quality a bit blurry. ,
26,Second,5:10:47,5:11:53,0:01:06,9,8,3,"The same thing, I also liked the bush in the center of the brick maze. ",Just how blurry it was also wish I could explore more. ,
27,First,5:22:43,5:24:57,0:02:14,6,5,7,It was very calm and picturesque ,Moving around made me super dizzy ,
27,Second,5:28:42,5:29:55,0:01:13,4,5,6,I liked that it was maze like and enclosed but open to the sky,I didn’t love the brick material ,
28,First,6:00:01,6:07:30,0:07:29,9,3,1, Like the solitude and trees. ,I feel a little trapped and i wanted to climb the tree. -William Holder-Soto,
28,Second,6:11:39,6:13:09,0:01:30,8,5,2,I liked how the bricks cast shadows on the bushes.,I disliked the overuse of brick. It was a bit overwhelming. -William ,
